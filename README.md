# SocialHub

## Description

My motivation to start this app was because I wanted to challenge myself to make an API for a social network that uses a NoSQL database.
The problem that this solves is it allows to handle a very large amount of data for the website. While working on this assignment I learned
how to use mongoDB along mongoose.

## Installation

You will need to do `npm i` to install
1) Express
2) Mongoose

## Usage
Will allow to add new people along with people thoughts and reactions. Includes update and remove as well.
